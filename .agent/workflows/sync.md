# Sync Workflow
**Goal:** Perform an immediate save-state to the cloud.

**Instructions:**
1. Call the terminal and run `python execution/git_sync.py "Manual Snapshot Sync"`.
2. Verify the push was successful.
3. If successful, confirm: "Current progress is saved to GitHub."
4. If it fails, report the specific Git error (e.g., merge conflict).
